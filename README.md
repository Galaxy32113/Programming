## Goals & Plans
*****
Hi, I wanted to put this out here because I need to keep this up somewhere with more responsability then just hoping 
that i will continue learning and not get stuck playing video games (can confirm.. um.. the hope failed me)

My main goals here is to learn a set of lanagauges, im measuring my skills within the lanugage as follows:

> ## Skill Measurment
> - ### Okay 
>> - Understand basic code 
>> - Create basic CLI based tools (e.g calculator and or timers)
>> - Basic debugging able to solve basic bugs and errors

>- ### Good 
>> - Build CLI applications (e.g customizable invoicing tools, basic data parsing and anylasis)
>> - Be able to use both Functional and or Object orientated programming if the language allows it
>> - Create basic GUI applications (e.g Gui calculator, screensaver maybe)
>> - better at debugging errors

>- ### Great
>> - Handle basic to advanced level networking using the language
>> - Implement AES or RSA and other encryption methods
>> - Build communication based GUI or CLI tools (e.g Chat applications, online PDF editor)
>> - Write programs that can at a basic level change itself during runtime

>- ### Advanced - Very Advanced
>> - Understand most code written in that language
>> - Be able to optomize for preformance heavy applications
>> - Build low latency applications if the language allows it (e.g video calling system, Basic Flight Controllers, custom API's)
>> - Develop my own smaller niche Reverse engineering programs in that language

>- ### ASM Specific "advanced" (since ASM = alot of code)
>> - Build basic GUI like a calculator only in ASM
>> - Use ASM with C or another low level program inline
>> - Reverse engineer some software in CTF's or something along those lines


.. That was a lot of writing
Now back to what i was saying, 

My current skills is no where near what i want.. unfortunetly. this is my current skills: 

>## Languages (Currently)
> - python (good - great)
> - luaU (good) [Roblox programming language not very useful outside of roblox]
> - C# (okay)
> - C++ (okay)


So after thinking for a bit about what i want to do as a potential job and just where my general curosity lies this is my goal "knowledge" 

>## Languages (Goal)
> - C (Advanced - Very Advanced)
> - ASM x86 (Advanced)

> - Rust (Great)
> - C++ (Great)
> - Golang (Great)
> - Python (Great)

> - Asm ARM AArch64 (Cortex-A) (Good - Great) [Same as ASM ARM Thumb-2]
> - Asm ARM Thumb-2 (Cortex-M) (Good - Great) [Did i get this name from AI... we wont talk about it.. it said its cool idk]

> - Javascript (Good) [Js deserves its own catagory fr fr :sob:]

> - Ada (Okay - Good) [Niche but i think it might be cool and important to know]
> - C# (Okay - Good)

I have no idea if this is too ambitious or not lol, probably is but .. its kind of where i want to be so even if i only learn like 50% of this .. i would rather fail harder then succeed with nothing..
I do have some other languages i want to leanr however they are not on my main list as they are niche they dont have measurment criterias because I have no idea if I will even attempt to learn them or not

> ## Languages (Others)
> - Spark [might be important or useful i have no idea]
> - Elixir [Idk why i heard its cool and useful for networking def intresting]
> - Colbol [banks?? right?]
> - Zig [I heard it might be cool for low level stuff?]


Okay.. soo.. as this plan has progressed I thought I want to add some Milestone projects these are kinda projects that i thought I wanna try to do once i get good enough . if... anyways

I will have a github folder here for each of these projects but hopefullyyyy nothing gets added in here until ive achieved at minium the C and ASM goal levels since making these
projects are probably much much harder then I expect..sooo.. if you see a file in there.... well.. force me to delete it ..and point out every thing wrong with it..! until i have completed
the advanced goal for both...


> ## Projects
> ***
> ### Flyable Drone
>> - I want to make a drone but not a quadcopter drone more a UAV inspired by the american "reaper drone" although this wouldn't be too hard to make with a purchased flight controller and maybe
     a glider kit but i want to make the flight controller from scratch with an esp32 or another micro controller although making a custom PCB is ... kinda hard soooo... yeah we will see I def want to add
     some safety features to it like detection for altitude dropping at a specific speed or altitiude rising at a specific feed as well as crosswind detection etc.. definetly a fun project but I need to get
     better at C for me to do this as I would want to try to write this with no libaries or minimal liberies although that would be difficult I think it would be good for learning.

> ### Mini OS
>> - This is definetly another more ambitious project, I don't want the OS to be crazy but it needs to be packaged to an ISO so bootcode etc... I want it to have  CLI based OS with
     Its own tiny programming language, no gui but i will try to make it a feature.. furthermore If.. If this is legal.. I think it would be really fun to have the os mimic windows API
     so you can run windows applications on it with more control over how the api works :D.

> ### "Covert" Communication Network
>> - This is also an intresting one probably easier then the other two but idk, I want to make a local node based communication system using Low MHZ i would need to be licesned for specific bands
     sooo.. probably just stick to 450 mhz or something along those lines .. albeit i would love to have a lower powered one that is on a lower Mhz band.. The node system will work with esp32's or
     raspberry pie's if its affordable and tuned antennas idk what type yet i gotta learn a lot more.. but anyways the communication will be low powered preferablly wirless over 1 or 2 km between each node
     the communication will be encrypted and only decrypted at source using some type of RSA but a lighter version or something like that im not sure exactly but ..the idea is there.

> ### Attempt to create polymorphic malware for learning (IF LEGAL idk but i feel like im blurring the lines once again)
>> - I want to build a system that doesn't just exist as malware though, I would love to build it around an actual CVE (although i heared they stopped funding CVE....) 
     but yea the name is pretty self explanatory i think.. or hope...


There are more but.. i think these are massive within themselves and probably a lot more then I think its going to be.. just like learning ASM :sob:..

I really don't want to change anything .. because If i change something too much on this plan it will just get me into a habit.. the only thing i can / want to do maybe is Add but not really change unless 
something does actually change in the world or in programming like if somehow ADA or Golang just gets removed off planet earth ... 

Also i do have a love for some cool chemistry & physics stuff but Ive never pushed to learn it .. even at a high school level only recently ive found an intrest in it..
especially to make stuff like jet engines etc... So ill probably be reaidng some of those textbooks

Now realsiticly this plan will take ~180 years or something to do.. but i don't have time for that sooo
im thinking of trying to push this to an unrealistic 2-5 years soo.. thats going to be fun.
anyways. i want to work at minium 15 - 30 hours a week on this hopefully that will help.. kind of..
  


IGNOREEE MY SPELLING IM SORRYYYYY :<
